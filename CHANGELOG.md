## Breaking Changes

The encoding API has been renamed and simplified:

| Original function | Equivalent function in v0.9 |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `encode_video`    | `save`                      |
| `prepareencoder`  | `open_video_out!`           |
| `appendencode!`   | `write`                     |
| `finish_encode`   | `close_video_out!`          |
| `close(io)`       | N/A (no longer needed)      |
| `mux`             | N/A (no longer needed)      |

The keyword arguments of the replacement functions may no longer be the same as
the original, so please see their documentation. In particular, note that
`AVCodecContextProperties` has been replaced with `encoder_options` and
`encoder_private_options`.

### Single-shot encoding
Before:
```julia
using VideoIO
props = [:priv_data => ("crf"=>"22","preset"=>"medium")]
encodevideo("video.mp4", imgstack, framerate=30, AVCodecContextProperties=props)
```

v0.9:
```julia
using VideoIO
encoder_options = (crf=23, preset="medium")
VideoIO.save("video.mp4", imgstack, framerate=30, encoder_options=encoder_options)
```

Note that `save` is not exported.
Also note that the encoder options are now provided as a named tuple.

VideoIO will automatically attempt to route these options between the public and private ffmpeg options, so for instance
it is possible to specify lossless settings as:
```julia
VideoIO.save("video.mp4", imgstack, framerate=30,
            encoder_options=(color_range=2, crf=0, preset="medium")
            )
```

however the most fail-safe way would be to specify the public and private options specifically
```julia
VideoIO.save("video.mp4", imgstack, framerate=30,
            encoder_options=(color_range=2),
            encoder_private_options=(crf=0, preset="medium")
            )
```

### Iterative encoding

Before:
```julia
framestack = map(x->rand(UInt8, 100, 100), 1:100) #vector of 2D arrays

using VideoIO
props = [:priv_data => ("crf"=>"22","preset"=>"medium")]
encoder = prepareencoder(first(framestack), framerate=24, AVCodecContextProperties=props)
open("temp.stream", "w") do io
    for i in eachindex(framestack)
        appendencode!(encoder, io, framestack[i], i)
    end
    finishencode!(encoder, io)
end

mux("temp.stream", "video.mp4", framerate) #Multiplexes the stream into a video container
```

v0.9:
```julia
framestack = map(x->rand(UInt8, 100, 100), 1:100) #vector of 2D arrays

using VideoIO
encoder_options = (crf=23, preset="medium")
open_video_out("video.mp4", first(framestack), framerate=30, encoder_options=encoder_options) do writer
    for frame in framestack
        write(writer, frame)
    end
end
```
Note that the multiplexing (mux) is now done in parallel with the encoding loop, so no need for an intermediate
".stream" file. Lower level functions should be used for more elaborate encoding/multiplexing tasks.

### Performance improvement

The speed of encoding `UInt8` frames losslessly has more than doubled.
And.. encoding no longer has verbose printing.

For `imgstack = map(x-> rand(UInt8, 2048, 1536), 1:100)`

v0.8.4
```julia
julia> props = [:color_range=>2, :priv_data => ("crf"=>"0","preset"=>"ultrafast")];

julia> @btime encodevideo("video.mp4", imgstack, AVCodecContextProperties = props)

```

## Known performance "regression"

Monochrome encoding with default arguments has become a bit slower in
v0.9. This is because by default user supplied data is assumed to be full-range
(jpeg), while the default libav output range is limited range (mpeg), and
VideoIO will now scale the user data to fit in the limited destination range.
Prior to v0.9, no such automatic scaling would be done, causing the user data to
be simply clipped. While this may seem like a regression, it is actually the
consequence of fixing a bug in the previous versions of VideoIO.

To avoid this slowdown, either specify `color_range=2` in `encoder_options`, or
alternatively specify the color space of the user-supplied data to already be
limited range. Note that `color_range=2` may produce videos that are
incompatible with some video players.

If you are encoding data that is already limited range, then the simplest way to
avoid automatic scaling is to indicate that the user data is in the FFmpeg
default colorspace. This is accomplished by setting
`input_colorspace_details = VideoIO.VioColorspaceDetails()` when encoding the
video. While the FFmpeg default color range is "unknown", settings this will
also prevent automatic scaling by VideoIO. If you have further details about
your input colorspace, and your colorspace differs from Julia's default, then
create a `VioColorspaceDetails` object with the settings that correspond to your
input data's colorspace.

In the future we hope to make this re-scaling more performant so it won't be as
noticeable.
